# NOTE:
Many thanks for your consideration! I had a fun time working on the challenge, both for the design and coding! Although the minimum code API requirements are fulfilled, there are still quite a few extra features built into the UI that I didn't get around to implementing; I may have been a bit too ambitious with the UX! I've made a note of the features below: 

Features to continue:
  - Search bar implementation (icon exists but not yet functional)
  - Adding top 10 TV Shows (populating existing TV tab in bottom nav bar)
  - Activating slide-out menu buttons to segue to views
  
Regardless of whether or not you're able to check it over the next week, I plan to continue to work on the project and build out the rest of the features currently in the UI. The API has many multi-faceted resources, and I'd like to make good use of it! 

Thank you again~
